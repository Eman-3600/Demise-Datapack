# Demise: A Minecraft Datapack

This 1.21.11 datapack causes players who die to become demons: spirits who have reduced health but can enter an ethereal form and torment other players.

## Recommendations

It is recommended when setting up a server with this datapack that you add a mod/plugin that stops spectators from teleporting to other players.
